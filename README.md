# An upper limit for current-induced domain wall motion in cylindrical nanowires
## Supplementary Material

This repository hosts the code to reproduce the computational results for the paper "An upper limit for current-induced domain wall motion in cylindrical nanowires."

Requirements:

- Fidimag - You can download a Virtual Machine with a ready to use copy of Fidimag from the [Virtual Micromagnetics project](http://virtual-micromagnetics.readthedocs.io/en/release/). Alternatively, you can [compile Fidimag from source](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/fidimag.git). We recommend using an Anaconda Python 3 environment to do this.

- To generate the animations, you will also need to install moviepy. You can do this from a terminal with

- Mathematica 10

```shell
pip install moviepy
```

Within each folder is the code which you can run in order to generate the figures.
