# An upper limit for current-induced domain wall motion in cylindrical nanowires
## Supplementary Material

This repository hosts the code to reproduce the computational results for the paper "An upper limit for current-induced domain wall motion in cylindrical nanowires."

Requirements:

- Fidimag - You can download a Virtual Machine with a ready to use copy of Fidimag from the [Virtual Micromagnetics project](http://virtual-micromagnetics.readthedocs.io/en/release/). Alternatively, you can [compile Fidimag from source](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/fidimag.git). We recommend using an Anaconda Python 3 environment to do this.

- To generate the animations, you will also need to install moviepy. You can do this from a terminal with
```shell
pip install moviepy
```

- Mathematica 10

Within each folder is the code which you can run in order to generate the figures. The simulation data in folder figure2 can be
generated from the scripts within the Animations folder. The data is placed here for convenience, as the simulations can take some
time to execute.
